# node-static-server

- This project is a simple static file web server created using Node.js and its native http, fs, and path modules.

- It serves HTML pages like index.html, about.html, and contact.html based on the requested URL.

- The server dynamically sets the correct Content-Type header for various file types and includes a basic 404 error handler for missing files.
